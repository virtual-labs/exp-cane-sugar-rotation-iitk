#### 4. Task & Assessment Questions:

Read the theory and comprehend the concepts related to the experiment. [LO1, LO2, LO3]
<br>

Sr. No |	Learning Objective	| Task to be performed by <br> the student  in the simulator | Assessment Questions as per LO & Task
:--|:--|:--|:-:
1.| Student will be able to identify the principle of rotation of plane polarized light. | Student will be given 4 images for the arrangement for determination of rotation of plane polarized light and will choose correct image from them. | The correct image for the arrangement for determination of rotation of plane polarized light:<br>(FIGURE 1 will be placed)<br>a) Image 1<br>b)Image 2<br>c)Image 3 <br>d)Image4
2.| Student will be able to describe the methodology to vary the concentration of the sugar solution and observe the variation in rotation of the plane polarized light. | Student will be given 4 images for the correct procedure to be followed in the experiment. He will choose correct image from them. | Choose the image which shows the correct order of the procedure to be followed in this experiment:<br>(FIGURE 2 will be placed)<br>a)Image 1<br>b) Image 2<br>c) Image 3<br> d) Image 4
3.| Student will be able to predict the specific rotation by using the concentration of the sugar solution, length of the polarimeter tube and the angle of rotation of the plane polarized light. | Student will complete the experimental setup and will take observations for the angle of rotation of the plane polarized light, concentration of the sugar solution, length of the polarimeter tube and the room temperature and enter these values in the table. | If the length of the polarimeter tube is 10 cm and the concentration of the sugar solution is 10% then at room temperature (25 0C) the specific rotation of the plane polarized light will be :<br>a) 56.5 deg cm-1 (g/cc)^-1<br><b) 66.5 deg cm-1 (g/cc)^-1<br>c) 76.5 deg cm-1 (g/cc)^-1<br>d) 86.5 deg cm-1 (g/cc)^-1
4.| Student will be able to examine the variation in the specific rotation due to variation of concentration of sugar solution, length of the polarimeter tube and the room temperature. | Student will choose the observations from the table and will plot a graph between angle of rotation and concentration of the sugar solution and will calculate the slope of the graph. | The graph between between angle of rotation and concentration of the sugar solution is:<br>a) straight line with positive slope and positive intercept<br>b) straight line with positive slope and negative intercept<br>c) straight line with negative slope and positive intercept<br>d) straight line with negative slope and negative intercept
5.| Student will be able to conclude the value of specific rotation and to calculate the percentage error with the standard value at a given temperature. | Students will place the value of the calculated slope of the graph formula for specific rotation and will find the percentage error of the calculated value of the specific rotation with the standard value at a given temperature.| On increasing the temperature of the sugar solution the specific rotation of the plane polarized light:<br>a) increases<br>b) decreases<br>c) remains unchanged<br>d) NOT
