<b> Experiment|     <b> 7. To measure specific rotation of cane sugar using Polarimeter 

<h5> About the Experiment : </h5> <br>

The specific rotation of the plane of polarization of sugar dissolved in water can be determined by the following formula
 S = 10θ/LC
 
 Where,    θ = rotation produced in degrees. 
           L= length of the tube in centimeter. 
           C = concentration of sugar solution in g/cc. 
Graphically S can be determined as

S=10/L * (slope of straight line obtained by plotting θ vs C)
